For top-down image processing we need:

1. Split image into grid cells
2. Examine each grid cell for presence of line/color/symbol

For initial/proof of concept run, propose:

1. Walls are black lines.
2. Player is either blue mark or any color circle.
3. Enemies are either red mark or any color cross.

Once we have this need to digitize and store in a format usable by top-down game engine... which we also need.
