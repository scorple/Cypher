Our project is a mobile app for Android that will allow players to use AR to play tabletop games, 
specifically D&D. Each player will have a marker that they can move around a map. 
Using these markers the app will show each players character and allow them to interact with loot and enemies
placed on the board. Loot and enemies will be represented by additional markers on the map used by the players.

For grading: The Source directory contains an Android Studio project in the Cypher directory. 
The actual java files can be found under [/Source/Cypher/app/src/main/java/com/semaphore_soft/apps/cypher/] (Source/Cypher/app/src/main/java/com/semaphore_soft/apps/cypher/)
